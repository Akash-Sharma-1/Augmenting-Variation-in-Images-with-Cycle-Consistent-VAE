**_Loss Plots of Training_**




## Style Transfer Grids

Generated an arrangement of style transfer grid from 8 sprites on the topmost row and another 8 sprites on the leftmost column side. These images were taken at random from the test set.

Each image is generated by taking the specified factor _[Identity]_ (after encoding) from the corresponding row sprite leftmost column and unspecified factor _[Style] _(after encoding) from the corresponding column sprite in the topmost row. After this both the factors were decoded to generate the image.



## (Linear Interpolation)

In each of the linear interpolation images, the bottom right and upper left contains the image pair taken from the test set.

**_Qualitative analysis_**


* The model is able to combine style (unspecified factors) and identity (specified factors) quite decently and smoothly. 
* Style(z) (unspecified factor) remains constant across columns and Identity(s) (specified factor) remains same across the rows. Hence, showing the effect of linear interpolation in the latent spaces.There is no direct transfer of viewpoints.
* Also shows the modelâ€™s capability of conditional image generation like conditioning on style(z) and generating/sampling for identity (s).

#### **_Analysis of the comparison:_**

The classification accuracies for the specified latent space (s) as well as the unspecified latent space (z) can be also seen as an indicator of specified factors of variation present in it while classifying the labels . In this case of disentangled representations, the unspecified latent space (z) since has very few amount of specified factors of variations, it should have low classification accuracy. While, specified latent space has a higher specified factors of variations, it should have a higher classification accuracy.

#### **_Analysis of the comparison:_**

As we see from comparing the both the regeneration losses, we see that the prediction network for z to s has higher loss than s to z indicating that there is a bigger difference in the generated image and original image in z to s network than the s to z prediction network. This might mean that in the former case we lose the identity factor of variation of the sprites because we have the style related factors only and hence,regenerating the identity of the character could be difficult to train.
